Advantages,Disadvantages
Simple and intuitive algorithm,Computationally expensive for large datasets
No assumptions about data distribution,Sensitive to irrelevant features
Can be used for both classification and regression,Sensitive to the scale of features
Adapts well to new data,Performance degrades in high dimensions (curse of dimensionality)
Effective for small to medium datasets,Difficult to choose optimal k value
No training period required (lazy learning),Memory intensive (stores entire dataset)
Can handle multi-class problems naturally,Slow prediction time
Robust to outliers with appropriate k,Sensitive to local structure of data
